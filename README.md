# overbond-pey

The function implemented in overbond.py uses imports from python libraries. 
In particular it uses xlsxwriter, openpyxl, and datetime.

By using openpyxl I search and parse the excel file and extract the necessary contents.
Then I store them in a nested array and use them to write into a newly created excel file.


Please use the correct input path for the excel file and ouput path as well from your own personal computer.

I have added an output excel file with the scatter plot as well.

Thanks,

Piyush
